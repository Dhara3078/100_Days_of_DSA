<h1 align="center"> 🎉🎊 DSA ✨ with C++ 🎊🎉 </h1>


### This repository contains all the coding problems solved by me.

* Find all topic wise questions in different folders🕵️‍♀️
* Problems are from Leetcode and Geeksforgeeks website.👩‍🏫✌


## Link for GFG DSA course 

* I have used this course to learn DSA in C++.

**Note : These are the playlists that I used while learning DSA. So for me they are the best playlist to learn those topics but for someone it can be any other playlist. If you know any other good playlist to learn DSA please add it here. 😊🙌**

## Big O Notation
### Data Structures in Big O Notation
| Data Structure | Add/Insert | Remove/Delete | Access/Get | Search/Contains | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Array | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Queue | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Stack | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| HashSet | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | - | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| HashMap | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Singly LinkedList | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Doubly LinkedList | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Circular Singly LinkedList | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Circular Doubly LinkedList | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Binary Search Tree | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Binary Min Heap | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Binary Max Heap | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |

### Sorting Algorithms in Big O Notiation
| Sort Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selection Sort | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(1)``` |
| Insertion Sort | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(1)``` |
| Quick Sort | ```O(n log n)``` | ```O(n log n)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(log n)``` |
| Merge Sort | ```O(n log n)``` | ```O(n log n)``` | ```O(n log n)``` | ```O(n)``` |


This will be the repository for C++ topic wise questions, practice questions and DSA :)
